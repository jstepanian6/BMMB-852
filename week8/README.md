# Week 8 
## Design file 
All the SRR were retrived from NCBI website. A design file was created and named "design.csv". 

Identify the sample names that connect the SRR numbers to the samples.
Create a design.csv file that connects the SRR numbers to the sample names.
Create a Makefile that can produce multiple BAM alignment files (you can reuse the one from the previous assignment) where from an SRR you can produce a BAM alignment file named after the sample name.
Using GNU parallel run the Makefile on all (or at least 10) samples.
Create a README.md file that explains how to run the Makefile
